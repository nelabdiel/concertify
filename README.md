# Concertify
Using the Spotify API, ConcertiPy pulls an artists you follow at random and displays their next concert. The goal for ConcertiPy is to eventually link it also to the Stubhub API to pull a list of concerts of the artists you follow on Spotify, based on proximity of both distance and date.

You can see the app live at http://concertipy.herokuapp.com
